# Planck Through Hole Kit

Current BOM (missing a 1.5k resistor):

## Build Notes (for version current on Github):

The ISP port is wired so that the standard ISP headers will need to be inserted from the bottom, with the nib at the rear, so it may be useful to cut a hole in the bottom plate if this is your main way of flashing it (I recommend BootloadHID though!). I plan on flipping this in a future version.

The pads around some of the components (DIP switch, USB port) are a little small for first-time solderers - this should be increased in future revisions.

The USB port protrudes a little bit, and was supposed to be flush - this will be set back where it should in future revisions.

The 20p capacitors aren't sized exactly how the footprints are like the other caps are - I'll be updating this as well.
